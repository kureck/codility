# OddOccurrencesInArray

[OddOccurrencesInArray problem description](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/)

I solved with a naive and an improved solution.

The improved solution took advantage of associative XOR property and the fact that doing this operation with itself results in zero and the operation with zero results in itself.

So, with the advantage of associative property the result operation is the unique odd number.
